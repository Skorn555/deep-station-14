﻿[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON THIS SERVER. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ffff00]This is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job, interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game. MRP places less emphasis on “winning” and more on just telling a story.[/color]

This is the "short" form of the rules, which has all the information any regular player should need. You can find the "long" form of the rules with more examples & clarifications of any ambiguity in our guidebooks > administration section, should you need it.

[color=#ff0000]1.0 Core Rules[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.1[/color] Be excellent to each other (don’t be a dick).

[color=#a4885c]1.2[/color] Make it fun for all involved (consider how you affect the round for others).

[color=#a4885c]1.2e[/color] If you’re unsure then ask. ahelp to keep it discrete.

[color=#a4885c]1.3[/color] Respect the admins and other players, they’re people too.

[color=#a4885c]1.4[/color] Discrimination based on protected characteristics is not allowed IC or OOC. No bigotry or hate speech here.

[color=#a4885c]1.4e[/color] The exception to this rule is speciesism, mutations and abominations, in character only.

[color=#a4885c]1.5[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color]. This includes comments not explicitly sexual in nature that contain words, phrases, or ideations that are deemed inappropriate. [color=#ff0000]If roleplay reaches a point where it has become sexual and/or uncomfortable, immediately stop and contact an administrator.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.6[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC. No spam or advertising.

[color=#a4885c]1.7[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt/crash the round/server. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow Roleplay Rules
    - Follow roleplay etiquette, using in-character (IC) and out-of-character (OOC) correctly, using proper text speech and an appropriate name.
    - Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player. Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (Memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
    - Character development can occur over rounds but each round is a soft-reset, meaning you can have previous shift experience but your character will never have died in the past.
    - Command and Security will be held to a higher standard for roleplay.
    - By picking prisoner, you have chosen to RP as a prisoner. You are still subject to rules pertaining to escalation, and should only seek to escape from the brig with good roleplay reasoning, such as abusive security, or a badly damaged perma.
    - Creatures taken over by player characters should act accordingly to their role and that creatures intelligence. Dumb animals won't dodge bullets.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Metagame Rules
    - Metagrudging or harassing or killing someone who harmed you in a previous life or round is not allowed. Do not act on things you saw while dead either.
	- Meta communication is also banned. Don’t use VC or other means to communicate IC or current round information to others.
	- Don't blur the lines between IC and OOC. Keep them strictly separate and remember rule 1.1.
	- Avoid streaming the current round.
	- If a player dies and is brought back by way of cloning or borgification, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them.
    - Players that are revived by using a defibrillator CAN recall what killed them and do not have any forgetfulness about what happened while they were alive.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] No Fun Rules
    - Command members besides the Logistics Officer are not permitted to leave the station on salvage expeditions, and are expected to stay on station.
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew while not being an antagonist (i.e. self-antagging).
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for one specific crew member in a way that would actively detract from the other player's enjoyment of the shift.
    - Do not, as a crewmate, hide the nuclear fission explosive (i.e. "the nuke") in an impossible to see location.
    - Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administrators in the relay will result in your removal. All ahelp messages are sent to the Singularity Network Discord.
    - Department strikes (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are discouraged. Members must obtain admin Central Command permission before engaging in this behavior.
    - AFK (aka SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as a conscious crewmate.
    - End-of-round grief (EORG) is only allowed post end round screen. This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and injuring without reason both *at* and *on the way to* Central Command.
        * Please be considerate to players trying to finish up their roleplay and do not wish to engage in EORG. Refer to rule 1.2.
        * This also extends to the following:
            * Neutral parties, such as space dragons or sentient artifacts activating harmful nodes.
            * Attempts to block the docking ports or ports leading into Central Command.

[color=#a4885c]4.1[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 15 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commit crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Security may inspect PDAs of detainees and withhold them for the duration of detention, but can only confiscate them if they are obviously contraband. Suspicion alone is NOT sufficient for PDA confiscation by Security.
	- Stop and search is only permitted on the relevant alert level. Check standard operating procedures.
    - Security is prohibited from checking crewmates for implants without reasonable suspicion.
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed or have committed suicide.
    - Executions must be for a capital crime, used only as a last resort, and MUST be authorized by the highest ranking member of Security, who will answer to the use of execution.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with.
	
[color=#a4885c]4.2.[/color] Security (and Command where applicable) should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests. Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force. Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used.

In the following special circumstances, lethal force may be used by Security:
    - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, lasers, disabling/stunning weapons with intent to kill, deadly melee weapons)
    - Suspect is equipped with dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/antagonists and is not cuffed nor surrendering (ex: Bloodred Hardsuit, China Lake, C-20R, etc.).
    - You determine that your life or the life of another person is in immediate danger.
    - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continuously manage to escape.
    - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the station/crew.

[color=#a4885c]4.3[/color] Follow Escalation Guidelines
    - Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
    - Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them. If they die, do not destroy or otherwise hide their body.
	
[color=#a4885c]4.4[/color] All constructed/summoned beings that have laws are bound by those laws and must abide by them.
    - If a being has a master, they MUST follow their master's orders.
    - Your master is held accountable if they order you to do something malicious.
        *This does not apply to breaking server rules. If you are ordered to do something that would break a server rule, disregard it and inform an admin.
    - Not having orders, or being given free will by your master does NOT give you permission to self-antag or grief the crew.
	
[color=#a4885c]4.5[/color] Follow Antagonist Guidelines
    - The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. However antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and can’t do.  If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin.
    - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.
    - Exploits, arrivals camping, unnecessary round extensions, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.
    - Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed. [color=#ff0000]Breaking these rules can result in a ban, whitelist removal, or both.[/color]
	
[color=#a4885c]4.6[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").
    - A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves, and the Head of Personnel does not need to give themselves armory access so they can go grab a gun. Have an actual reason for needing these things.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or deadly poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
    - Don't preemptively hide antagonist objectives or preemptively secure them with higher security than normally required.
    - Don't manufacture or prepare things for the "end of the round" when the shuttle docks with Central Command.
	
[color=#a4885c]4.7[/color] Psionics
    - Players that have psionic powers are allowed to use them at-will to accomplish their roleplay goals. It should be noted that in-character consequences can happen as a result of their use, including being stripped of psionic powers or even death.
    - As a psionic mantis, it is not your goal to hunt down psionics. Do not mindbreak others against their will solely because they have psionic powers.


[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
    - Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
    - All of these rules apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.


If you have any questions about these rules, please use the admin help (ahelp) menu by hitting F1 in-game or clicking the “Ahelp” button in the lobby.
[color=#ff0000]Please report players who violate this rule.[/color]
